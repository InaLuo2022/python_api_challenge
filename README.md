## Part 1: WeatherPy
### Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
### Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship

## Summary:
### Temperature vs. Latitude
In Northern Hemisphere, the r-value -0.87 shows that the linear regression model is very fit for explaning the trend of temperature changes. It is obvious that cities near Antarctica is currently experiencing extreme low temperature down to -30Â°C. The lower latitude in North Hemspohere shows higher temperature.

In Southern Hemisphere, temperature demostrates increase continuousely when latitude is decrease. This means cities near equator are experiencing higher temperature than where the cities are far away from equator. 

### Humidity vs. Latitude
In Northern Hemisphere, the r-value -0.49. The scatter dots is centerized in the high level of humidity (80% or more), when the latitute N is more than 40. The scatter dots shows decenterized in the area between equater to 40 degrees north of the latitude. The linear regression demostrates the humidity rate slightly increase when the latitude degree is going up in the north hemisphere. 

In Southern Hemisphere, the r-value is only 0.29. This may show that the linear regression may not be the best option to demostrate the correlation between humidity and latitude. Cities in tropical area located in lower latitude degree in the South is more humid than whose cities located in higher south latitude degree.

### Cloudiness vs. Latitude
The r-value is 0.38 in Northern Hemisphere and 0.41 in Souther Hemisphere. Both of scatter dots shows decenterized overall. The cloudiness rate is so high in some cities in both around equator and antartica. The linear slope is contiously increase positively.

The wind speed shows very stable in average 3m/s in Northern Hemisphere. It records high wind speed in some cities located in between 20 to 30 degree south. The overall wind speed drop when the lantitude degree decrease in Southern Hemisphere.

## Part 2: VacationPy
Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame
Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to certain weather condition
Find nearby hotels
